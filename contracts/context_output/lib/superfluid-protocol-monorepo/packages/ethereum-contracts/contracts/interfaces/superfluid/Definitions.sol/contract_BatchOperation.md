///  Call spec:

### OPERATION_TYPE_SUPERFLUID_CALL_APP_ACTION

```solidity

uint32 internal constant OPERATION_TYPE_SUPERFLUID_CALL_APP_ACTION = 2 + 200
```

### OPERATION_TYPE_SIMPLE_FORWARD_CALL

```solidity
///  @dev SimpleForwarder.forwardCall batch operation type
///  Call spec:
///  forwardCall(
///      target,
///      data
///  )
///  NOTE: This operation allows to make arbitrary calls to arbitrary targets.
///  The calls are routed through a dedicated utility contract `SimpleForwarder`.
///  This is important because the host contract has privileged access to other framework contracts,
///  SuperTokens, SuperApps etc.
///  Allowing arbitrary calls to arbitrary targets with the host as sender would thus be unsafe.
uint32 internal constant OPERATION_TYPE_SIMPLE_FORWARD_CALL = 1 + 300
```

### OPERATION_TYPE_ERC2771_FORWARD_CALL

```solidity
///  @dev ERC2771Forwarder.forward2771Call batch operation type
///  Call spec:
///  forward2771Call(
///      target,
///      msgSender,
///      data
///  )
///  NOTE: In the context of this operation, the `ERC2771Forwarder` contract acts as the
///  _trusted forwarder_ which must be trusted by the _recipient contract_ (operation target).
///  It shall do so by dynamically looking up the ERC2771Forwarder used by the host, like this:
///  function isTrustedForwarder(address forwarder) public view returns(bool) {
///      return forwarder == address(host.getERC2771Forwarder());
///  }
///  If used in the context of a `forwardBatchCall`, we effectively have a chaining/nesting
///  of ERC-2771 calls where the host acts as _recipient contract_ of the enveloping 2771 call
///  and the ERC2771Forwarder acts as the _trusted forwarder_ of the nested 2771 call(s).
///  That's why `msgSender` could be either the actual `msg.sender` (if using `batchCall`)
///  or the relayed sender address (if using `forwardBatchCall`).
uint32 internal constant OPERATION_TYPE_ERC2771_FORWARD_CALL = 2 + 300
```
